# Laws

Rules this project must never break, each backed by a test that proves it. One law per
file, `NNN-slug.md`, numbered in the order they were written and revised in place.

The pattern is Bend's `LAWS.bend` / `PROOF.bend` split, without the language: the human
states the claim, the agent writes the proof, and the gate refuses a merge while any enacted
law is unproven or failing.

```
deno run -A ~/.claude/tools/laws-check.js          # static: every enacted law has a proof
deno run -A ~/.claude/tools/laws-check.js --run    # and every proof passes
```

Success prints `All laws hold. (N enacted, M proposed)`. Anything else is a stop.

## Who edits what

| Field or section | Owner | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `status`, `title`, `## Statement`, `## Counterexample looks like` | Human | An agent may create a file as `status: proposed` and may not edit these on an enacted law |
| `status: proposed` -> `enacted` | Human | Or an agent, only when the user says "enact" in that turn |
| `proof`, `check`, `## Proof notes` | Agent | Written by `/prove`, the only fields an agent touches on an enacted law |
| `status: enacted` -> `retired` | Human | A retired law keeps its file; the number is never reused |

A law is a claim about behaviour, not a preference. "Sort returns ascending output for every
input" is a law. "Prefer records over classes" is a convention and belongs in
`docs/conventions.md`. "No React" is a constitution rule; if it can be checked by a test, it
is also a law, and the constitution points here.

## File format

```markdown
---
id: L001
title: Strict mapping rejects an unmapped property
status: enacted
kind: property
scope: src/Extrode.Jaunty/Internals/Read/DrDispatcher.cs
proof: tests/Extrode.Jaunty.UnitTests/Laws/L001StrictMappingTests.cs
check: dotnet test --filter Law=L001
enacted: 2026-09-18
---

## Statement
For every entity type T with at least one public writable property, and every result set
missing a column for one of those properties, `Query<T>` in Strict mode throws
InvalidOperationException naming the property.

## Counterexample looks like
A result set missing `Name`, and `Query<Product>` returning a Product with Name == null.

## Proof notes
Mutation: commented out the throw in DrDispatcher.cs:64; L001 failed with 3 counterexamples.
```

- `id` is `L` plus the file's three-digit number. `laws-check.js` refuses a mismatch.
- `status` is `proposed`, `enacted` or `retired`. Only enacted laws gate.
- `kind` picks the proof shape: `property` (for all generated inputs, an output relation
  holds), `invariant` (after any sequence of operations, a state predicate holds), `guard`
  (a table of inputs and the verdict each must get).
- `scope` is the file or symbol the law is about, so `/prove` targets real code.
- `proof` is the test file, relative to the repo root. It must contain the id literally.
- `check` is the command that exits 0 when the law holds. Optional: when absent it is derived
  from the runner (below). Set it when the derived form is wrong for this repo.

## Tagging a proof

The id appears in the test so the runner can select it and a reader can find it:

| Runner | Tag | Derived check |
|---|---|---|
| xunit (C#) | `[Trait("Law", "L001")]` on the class | `dotnet test --filter Law=L001` (VSTest mode only; under a `global.json` test runner of Microsoft.Testing.Platform the filter is silently ignored and "Zero tests ran" exits 5, so set `check` to `dotnet build <proj> && dotnet <built>.dll -trait "Law=L001"`) |
| `deno test` | test name starts with `L001:` | `deno test -A --filter "L001:"` |
| node with a `test` script | test name starts with `L001:` | `npm test -- -t "L001:"` |
| pytest | test name starts with `test_l001_` | `pytest -k l001` |
| run-directly Deno suite | `// L001:` comment above the case(s) | none; set `check` to the suite command with its argv, e.g. `deno run -A hooks/x.test.js hooks/x.exe` |

## Writing a law

1. `/laws new <statement>` drafts the file as `proposed` with the next number.
2. Read it. Tighten the statement until a counterexample is describable. Set `status: enacted`.
3. `/prove L###` writes the test, breaks the code to confirm the test fails, restores it, and
   fills `proof` and `check`.
4. `laws-check.js --run` prints `All laws hold.` and `/implement` will not merge without it.
